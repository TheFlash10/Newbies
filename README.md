# Newbies
A repository made for the beginners in GitHub to get used to it

You can add notebooks, .md file related to the topic to explain it, or the maths behind it... literally anything !!

This would help you to create pull requests, get it merged and get used to the real open source environment.

Also you could add any new topic you want to add in the issues... I will suggest and reply to you ASAP whether to do it or not.

You could also expand the horizon to any other development/coding topics !!!!

Enjoy Github :)
